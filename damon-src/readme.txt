Broker:
    The broker should take a single ticker (or variable number of tickers), start/end date and source
    and return to the user a dataframe object (having recorded it as a CSV) while also performing
    specific calculations such as percent change, rolling 50 and rolling 200 moving averages,
    (more moving averages can be added in another script)
